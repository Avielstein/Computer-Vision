### 1\. Grad-CAM: Unifying Visualization, Agriculture, and Learning Dynamics

**Description:** This project consolidates three applications of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) into a comprehensive exploration of visualization techniques within deep learning. It demonstrates Grad-CAM's versatility in interpreting CNN decisions across varied contexts: standard image classification, agricultural produce classification, and visualizing model learning evolution.

**Highlights:**

1.  **Core Grad-CAM Techniques**: Introduces Grad-CAM with a practical TensorFlow tutorial, focusing on visualizing CNN focus areas through heatmaps.
2.  **Agricultural Application**: Extends Grad-CAM to classify fruits and vegetables, illustrating its utility in specialized data analysis.
3.  **Learning Visualization**: Transforms static Grad-CAM outputs into dynamic videos, showcasing model training progress and decision refinement.

The project offers a holistic view of Grad-CAM's utility, combining foundational knowledge, sector-specific application, and innovative learning visualization to enhance model interpretability and application insight.

### 4\. Anonymized Facial Expression: Dynamic Blurring with Superpixel Segmentation

**Description:** This project demonstrates a novel approach to facial anonymization, integrating superpixel segmentation with dynamic blurring to preserve facial expressions. Through practical Python implementations, it achieves real-time anonymization of faces in static images or video streams without sacrificing the expressiveness of facial features. Leveraging OpenCV for robust face detection and skimage for advanced segmentation, the project illustrates a sophisticated method to balance privacy and emotional conveyance.
